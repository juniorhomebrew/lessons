# Junior Homebrew Lesson Plans
This repository holds all of the lessons that are part of the Junior Homebrew Club scheme of work. 

The lessons are grouped by language/ platform and content. There is no specific order to use the lessons in, however, although it may be obvious, lessons which introduce a new function or concept should be taught before those concepts are required in more complex projects. The introductory lessons usually cover only that one concept so should be fairly easily identified.
