# Hello, world!
This is our first lesson in computer science, and we'll be exploring how a computer reads code, but also having some fun in learning how to use Scratch!

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a web app (or *programming environment*) where we can learn how computers process code and instructionsâ€“but also make cool, visual stuff really easily. 

### But I've used Scratch!
Don't worry! Lots of primary schools use Scratch, but some don't. We need to make sure everyone gets to grips with it, and we're only spending one lesson messing around with all the tools to get something together. 

## The task
We will be making our own movie in Scratch, under the title: **"Hello, World!"**. We have a template for you [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/126051692/#editor), but you don't have to use that if you don't want to! 

If you've used Scratch before, great! Get started! But if not, we'll teach you all about Sprites and backgrounds and how to get the sea moving to start off with!

First, let's get you a Scratch account!

### Signing up to Scratch
1. On the page we linked to above (or [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/126051692/#editor), if you missed it), click the orange "remix" button. 
2. A dialogue should pop up, and now click "Or Join Scratch". This brings you to another screen, where you have to enter a username (be creative), and a password (make it complicated, but don't forget it). 
3. Enter your birth month and year, along with your gender and country (United Kingdom). 
4. Now you'll be asked to enter your email address. **Use your school one**. This is just because it's easy!

Then you're ready to go! Congrats!

### What are Sprites?
In the bottom left hand corner of your screen you'll see some pictures with the title "Sprites".
